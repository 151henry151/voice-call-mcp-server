# Voice Call MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables Claude and other AI assistants to initiate and manage voice calls using Twilio and OpenAI.

    MCP->>Twilio: 2) Place outbound call via Twilio API
    Twilio->>Phone: 3) Ring the destination phone
    Twilio->>MCP: 4) Call status updates & audio callbacks (webhooks)
    MCP->>OpenAI: 5) Forward real-time audio to OpenaAI's realtime model
    OpenAI->>MCP: 6) Return voice stream
    MCP->>Twilio: 7) Send voice stream
    Twilio->>Phone: 8) Forward voice stream
    Note over Phone: Two-way conversation continues <br>until the call ends
```


## Features

- Make outbound phone calls via Twilio üìû
- Process call audio in real-time with OpenAI üéôÔ∏è
- Pre-built prompts for common calling scenarios (like restaurant reservations) üçΩÔ∏è
- Automatic public URL tunneling with ngrok üîÑ
- Secure handling of credentials üîí

## Why MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) bridges the gap between AI assistants and real-world actions. By implementing MCP, this server allows AI models like Claude to:

1. Initiate actual phone calls on behalf of users
2. Process and respond to real-time audio conversations
3. Execute complex tasks requiring voice communication

This open-source implementation provides transparency and customizability, allowing developers to extend functionality while maintaining control over their data and privacy.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 22
  - If you need to update Node.js, we recommend using `nvm` (Node Version Manager):
    ```bash
    nvm install 22
    nvm use 22
    ```
- Twilio account with API credentials
- OpenAI API key
- Ngrok Authtoken

## Configuration

The server requires several environment variables:

- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`: Your Twilio account SID
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Twilio auth token
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN`: Your ngrok authtoken
- `RECORD_CALLS`: Set to "true" to record calls (optional)

### Claude Desktop Configuration

To use this server with Claude Desktop, add the following to your configuration file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "voice-call": {
      "command": "npm",
      "args": [
        "start"
      ],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/voice-call-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID": "your_account_sid",
        "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN": "your_auth_token",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your_openai_api_key",
        "NGROK_AUTHTOKEN": "your_ngrok_authtoken"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After that, restart Claude Desktop to reload the configuration. 
If connected, you should see Voice Call under the üî® menu.

## Example Interactions with Claude

Here are some natural ways to interact with the server through Claude:

1. Simple call:
```
Can you call +11234567890 and let them know I'll be 15 minutes late for our meeting?
```

2. Restaurant reservation:
```
Please call Delicious Restaurant at +11234567890 and make a reservation for 4 people tonight at 7:30 PM.
```

3. Appointment scheduling:
```
Call my dentist at +11234567890 and schedule a cleaning appointment for sometime next week.
```

## Important Notes

1. **Phone Number Format**: All phone numbers must be in E.164 format (e.g., +11234567890)
2. **Rate Limits**: Be aware of your Twilio and OpenAI account's rate limits and pricing
3. **Voice Conversations**: The AI will handle natural conversations in real-time
4. **Call Duration**: Be mindful of call durations as they affect OpenAI API and Twilio costs
5. **Public Exposure**: Be aware that the ngrok tunnel exposes your server publicly for Twilio to reach it (though with a random URL and protected by a random secret)

## Troubleshooting

Common error messages and solutions:

1. "Phone number must be in E.164 format"
   - Make sure the phone number starts with "+" and the country code

2. "Invalid credentials"
   - Double-check your TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID and TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN. You can copy them from the [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com)

3. "OpenAI API error"
   - Verify your OPENAI_API_KEY is correct and has sufficient credits

4. "Ngrok tunnel failed to start"
   - Ensure your NGROK_AUTHTOKEN is valid and not expired

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here are some areas we're looking to improve:

- Implementing support for multiple AI models beyond the current implementation
- Adding database integration for storing conversation history locally
- Improving latency and response times for better call experiences
- Enhancing error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Adding more pre-built conversation templates for common scenarios
- Implementing better call monitoring and analytics
